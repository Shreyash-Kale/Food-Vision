An end-to-end CNN Image Classification Model that identifies the food in your image.

I worked out a pre-trained Image Classification Model that comes with Keras and then retrained it on the infamous Food101 Dataset.

Fun Fact :
The Accuracy of DeepFood was 77.4% and our model's is 84%. Interestingly, DeepFood's model took 2-3 days to train while our's was ~1.5 hrs.

> Dataset: Food101 (75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images.)

> Model: EfficientNetB1
