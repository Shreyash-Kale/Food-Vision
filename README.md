# Food-Vision 🍔👁

> A Deep Learning Model to classify hundred and one classes of food items, using all of the data from the Food101 dataset.

**With the goal of beating [DeepFood](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304163308_DeepFood_Deep_Learning-Based_Food_Image_Recognition_for_Computer-Aided_Dietary_Assessment)**, a paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.

> 75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images.

The model (**80.2% Accuracy**) has performed better than the DeepFood paper (77.4% Accuracy)!

And that too within just **~2 hours** of training and evaluating the model versus DeepFood's quoted 2-3 days!

> Here are some examples of how the model predicts the accuracy of the food images:
