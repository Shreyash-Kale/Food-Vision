# FoodNet 🍔👁

> Please go through the "FoodNetipynb" colab file for source code. 
An end-to-end CNN Image Classification Model which identifies the food in your image.

I worked out with a pretrained Image Classification Model that comes with Keras and then retrained it on the infamous Food101 Dataset.

Fun Fact :

The Accuracy of DeepFood was 77.4% and our model's is 84%. The interesting thing is, DeepFood's model took 2-3 days to train while our's was ~1.5 hrs.

> Dataset : Food101 (75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images.)

> Model : EfficientNetB1
